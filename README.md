# Quantavious - AI Stock Ensemble Pipeline

Quantavious is an AI-powered stock price prediction pipeline inspired by Ed Quantavious's quantitative trading philosophy.  
It combines multiple models ‚Äî including gradient boosting, deep learning, and sentiment analysis ‚Äî to produce predictions with uncertainty estimates.

## Features
- **Data Ingestion** from Yahoo Finance & news APIs
- **Feature Engineering** with technical indicators & sentiment
- **Model Ensemble** (LightGBM, XGBoost, Prophet, Transformers)
- **Meta-Learner** trained on historical model performance
- **Uncertainty Estimation**
- **Backtesting**
- **Streamlit UI** for interactive predictions


üß† What each component does (and why)

GBM (Geometric Brownian Motion)
Assumes log-returns are normally distributed with drift Œº and volatility œÉ. Good baseline for medium/long-term drift behavior.

We compute Œº and œÉ from recent log-returns.

Use closed-form expectation for the point forecast.

Use Monte-Carlo to estimate VaR/CVaR tail risk.

OU (Ornstein‚ÄìUhlenbeck)
Mean-reverting process on log-prices. Good for short-term pullbacks or reversion to equilibrium.

We estimate Œ∫ (speed), Œº_log (equilibrium), and daily noise via OLS.

Forecast is the OU mean at the chosen horizon.

ARIMA(1,1,1)
Captures short-term autocorrelation after differencing. Helpful for 1d‚Äì1w horizons.

If data is too short/unstable, we gracefully drop it and re-weigh the blend.

Schr√∂dinger-inspired FFT model
We detect dominant cycles in detrended returns via FFT and project a sinusoid on log-returns ‚Äî a proxy for multi-modal uncertainty / ‚Äúprobability amplitude‚Äù behavior. It often helps on 1w‚Äì3mo when there are seasonal/weekly patterns.

Meta-Blend (adaptive)
Horizon-aware weights:

1d: ARIMA/OU dominate, a little GBM & FFT

5d: still short-term heavy

1mo+: increasingly GBM & FFT, less ARIMA

Risk (VaR/CVaR)
From GBM Monte-Carlo distribution over the horizon:

VaR(95%): a 1-in-20 worst-loss threshold

CVaR(95%): average loss beyond VaR (tail severity)
